-- SYRD-203: an idle implementer got no recovery nudge after a Director kickback.
--
-- Live on SYRD-202. The Director returned it with an instruction, the
-- implementer worked and then stopped with the ticket still actionable, and
-- neither the implementer nor the Director heard anything. The cause was not
-- the staged-pointer directorctl delivery the incident went through: returning
-- a ticket enqueues a `transition` notification to the DIRECTOR as well as to
-- the new owner, and this guard skipped any ticket for which the Director had
-- ANYTHING queued. The Director's own kickback armed a suppression that lasted
-- until that row was delivered, and because both notifications were enqueued in
-- one loop it took the implementer's repair prompt with it.
--
-- Recovery is now staged, per the corrected specification: a turn ending
-- unresolved prompts the OWNER, and the Director is told only if the ticket is
-- still unresolved after a grace period or the prompt could not be delivered.
-- The escalation half runs on ordinary passes rather than turn ends, because a
-- silent owner ends no turns and that is precisely the case it exists for.
