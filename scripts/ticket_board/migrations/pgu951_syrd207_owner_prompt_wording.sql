-- SYRD-207: the owner prompt must not claim the Director already knows.
--
-- Staged recovery means the owner is told FIRST and alone, and the Director only
-- if the grace expires without the ticket being resolved. The message carried
-- over from pgu948, where both audiences were told at once, and it still ended
-- "The Director has already been told." Under staging that sentence is false at
-- the moment it is delivered, and false in the direction that matters: it tells
-- the person who can still fix this quietly that the escalation has already
-- happened, which removes the reason to act before it does.
--
-- Live on SYRD-206: the owner prompt said the Director had been told, and the
-- trace showed zero Director rows for that ticket at that instant.
--
-- CREATE OR REPLACE rather than DROP + CREATE: the signature is unchanged, so
-- replacing it keeps the privileges pgu950 granted. The grant is restated anyway
-- because it costs nothing and a board arriving here another way should not have
-- to depend on that reasoning.
