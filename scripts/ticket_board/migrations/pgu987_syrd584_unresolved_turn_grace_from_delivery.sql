-- SYRD-584: on Otto (release f92a3d4d) the Director was told "main ended a
-- turn without resolving OTTO-139 ... and the grace period has passed after
-- being prompted" while main was ten minutes into a turn on OTTO-139. main had
-- ended a turn unresolved; its repair prompt was enqueued, then held behind a
-- Codex menu until the Director answered it; once delivered, it started the
-- turn that was still running when the escalation fired. The escalation timed
-- its grace from the prompt's ENQUEUE and never asked whether the owner had
-- worked since.
--
-- The grace now runs from the prompt's delivery (its send trace) once it is
-- delivered, and from its enqueue while it waits, as before. A turn the
-- owner's CLI hook shows started after the prompt cancels the wave while it
-- runs; once it ends unresolved, the grace runs again from that end. The
-- listener passes those hook facts as a new parameter; a listener that does
-- not (an older release mid-upgrade) gets the delivery-time rule alone. The
-- signature changes, so the old one is dropped (a defaulted new parameter
-- beside it would make every three-argument call ambiguous) and the grant is
-- restated. schema.sql and rbac.sql carry the same.
